Super basic site here running Preact. Essentially used this to learn a bit about preact. I think majority of apps could use Preact, but maybe not 100% worth it if you import other UI kits and what not.

## CLI Commands

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm start

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# test the production build locally
npm run serve

# run tests with jest and preact-render-spy
npm run test
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [CLI Readme](https://github.com/developit/preact-cli/blob/master/README.md).
